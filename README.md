# README_Generator

CLI README Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a README.md file from the backend using node.js. This shows my ability to use node to write files. By using nodes you can write to files and create html pages, README's and many more things. This solves not using the browser to write files and uses the command line. I learned how to use inquirer, built in methods in nodes like "fs" to write to files and a node util promisify.
